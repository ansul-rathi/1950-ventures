        Despite global economic uncertainties, India's growth outlook remains
        robust, building on a decade of stellar performance. This growth is

        services sector. India offers significant opportunity and continues to
        attract foreign investment because of its young workforce, expanding
        digital infrastructure, and the government's focus on development and
        ease of doing business.
