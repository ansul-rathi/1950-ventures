      Please read the following terms and conditions (“Terms”). They govern your use of this website and its associated services, including email newsletters, associated content distribution platforms, and public 1950 online social media accounts (collectively, “the Services”). By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. We may update these Terms from time to time and any modifications will be effective immediately upon posting unless we indicate otherwise. If you use the Services after any changes to the Terms have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. We suggest that you review these Terms periodically for changes.

      1950 is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Services are intended solely to provide general information about 1950, its services to entrepreneurs, and its people. Nothing in the Services is directed at nor should be relied upon by any investors or prospective investors in any vehicle managed by 1950. 1950 does not intend to solicit or make its investment advisory services available to the general public.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-4">
      Under no circumstances should any information provided in the Services be considered as an offer soliciting the purchase or sale of any security or interest in any pooled investment vehicle sponsored, discussed, or mentioned by 1950 nor should it be construed as an offer to provide investment advisory services. Such offers or solicitations will be made separately and only by means of the confidential offering documents of the specific pooled investment vehicles which should be read in their entirety, and only to those who, among other requirements, meet certain qualifications under federal securities laws.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-4">
      Such investors, defined as accredited investors and qualified purchasers, are generally deemed capable of evaluating the merits and risks of prospective investments and financial matters. There can be no assurances that 1950 investment objectives will be achieved or investment strategies will be successful. Any investment in a vehicle managed by 1950 involves a high degree of risk including the risk that the entire amount invested is lost.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-4">
      Any investments or portfolio companies described or referred to in the Services are not representative of all investments in vehicles managed by 1950 and there can be no assurance that the investments described are, or will be, profitable or that other investments made in the future will have similar character or results. Excluded from this list are investments for which the issuer has not provided permission for 1950 to disclose publicly.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-4">
      Any opinions expressed in the Services reflect 1950 views or those of individual posters, and are subject to change. Certain information contained in the Services has been obtained from third-party sources, including from portfolio companies of funds managed by 1950. While taken from sources believed to be reliable, 1950 has not independently verified such information and makes no representations about the enduring accuracy of the information or its appropriateness for a given situation.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-4">
      The discussions and opinions expressed herein are not intended to provide investment, accounting, tax, or legal advice. Nothing in the Services is a recommendation that you purchase, sell or hold any security or other investment, or that you pursue any investment style or strategy. The content of this website is presented on an “as is” basis with no warranties, express or implied, of any kind with respect to the Services. Charts provided herein are for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon when making any investment decision.

    <p class="mb-4">
      Certain statements that individual personnel make may constitute “forward-looking statements” under the Privacy Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. To the extent any information herein constitutes forward-looking statements (which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipation,” “upside,” “potential,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend,” “forecast,” “target” or “believe” or comparable terminology), please note that, due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events, results, or performance may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. 1950 expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement in the event it later turns out to be inaccurate — whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Any projections, estimates, forecasts, targets, prospects and/or opinions expressed in these materials are subject to change without notice and may differ or be contrary to opinions expressed by others. Past results of 1950 pooled investment vehicles, investments, or investment strategies are not necessarily indicative of future results.
